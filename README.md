# Data-Visualisation-of-Nobel-Laureates
The Nobel Prize is a prestigious international award that recognizes individuals and or- ganizations for their outstanding achievements in various fields. In this study, we have performed a visual analysis of the Nobel Laureate dataset [1], which contains comprehen- sive information about all Nobel Prize winners up to 2019. Using Vega-Lite, we designed an interactive chart that demonstrates the distribution and association of Nobel laureates by birthplace, gender, award category, and age. People who are interested in the demo- graphics and characteristics of the winners may be the users of our visualisation design. Our goal is to provide users with an efficient and aesthetically pleasing visualization to gain a deeper understanding of the characteristics and commonalities of these outstanding laureates and their changes from 1901 to 2016.

## Dataset
The dataset comprises two tables: metadata of Nobel laureates and a list of each laureate’s publications. 

## Data preprocessing
Using Python

## Overall Visualization
The 800x600 rectangular dashboard provides an optimal visual effect in widescreen when accessed by computer. The dashboard title is displayed at the top, allowing users to understand the topic at a glance, and the data source label is situated below. Labeling the data source is essential for any data analysis result display, as it helps interested parties understand the source data more deeply. The remaining space is dedicated to data visualization. The chart uses blue and orange to represent male and female, respectively, using contrasting colors to emphasize gender differences. The left-side scatter plots display each award record, showing the distribution of award winners by birthplace and the distribution of award age over time. The right-side bar chart and histogram display aggregated results for each award record, revealing the distribution of award winners by category and age, respectively.
